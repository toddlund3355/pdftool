This is just a little program I wrote that accepts a single pdf filename as a cmd parameter. It then creates a jpg of the first page of the pdf and an MD file that has a link to the pdf as well as a thumbnail of the first page using the jpg. I use this as part of my workflow to ingress pdf documents into obsidian (or any markdown based system).

I also scrape out all the words from the pdf (since I run ocr as I scan documents with the text going into the pdf) and adds them to the md file. This helps with search.

That's it. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
